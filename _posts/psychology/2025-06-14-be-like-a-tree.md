This blog is not about any specific topic. These days I have been walking, walking like a wanderer.

I have noticed that even walking is different every other day, some days it's quite pleasant while some days it's just a few thousand steps. It becomes pleasant when I get a good thought during walking, some people get these thoughts in the bathroom, some in sleep and some while walking. I am sure there is an ancient technique to get in this state more often. Perhaps this state is called "Darshan".

When I was in Patna, I used to be occupied with a lot of work, every day from Monday to Saturday we used to rush to college in the morning and then stay there till evening. I was so harsh on myself, I didn't use to save time for myself. In those days to get my 'Me-Time' I used to walk from Sai Temple to Hostel while holding my bicycle on my right side. These walks helped me take some decisions and execute things innovatively. e.g. I won a singing competition with a team with no prior singing experience.

### How does it help me?
Walking takes me to a state which is not exactly thinking or stopping to think, it's kind of subtle focus and then out of sudden from nowhere I get a thought, sometimes a solution to my problem which has been eating me for a while.
Whatever this state of mind is, I don't know what it is, I am not sure this itself is Darshan or something else, it's helpful. It's pleasant and sometimes exciting.

### Evening Walk
When I get a new thought which I have not read earlier I consider my walk as a good one, it doesn't happen every day.
On Saturday evening, I had already completed around 5-6 KMs and was returning home, bought a bottle of water after putting a lot of thought to pick from Lassi, Cold Drink or Energy Drink. I was sipping and walking back then I got an urge to sit somewhere, I couldn't find a decent spot so I continued walking, when I was about 1 KM away from my home, there is an old peepal tree with a huge trunk and base covered with brick walls and platform. I sat on the platform and continued to take sips of water. People were passing by to their homes from market wondering why a man is sitting under a tree with a bottle in hand in the middle of nowhere. I was a bit scared too because I have heard superstitious stories about sitting under a peepal tree at night.

### Be Like a Tree
In that moment I got a thought why don't you become like a tree, doesn't matter if everyone stops you, doesn't matter if everyone is holding you back, just grow. Grow as much as you can, spread your wings like the tree has these large branches. When people will be exhausted with hustle they will seek relief in you. Aged or young, rich or poor everyone sits with a tree. Tree doesn't say anything it just sits with us, its presence is enough to take away all of our stress.

With this thought I returned home and here I am reviving my old blog website and writing this thought before it vanishes away.

Now kids are behind my back bugging me to let them play game on this PC. Bye !!
